# Project #3 Reflection
When I started this project I had a few goals in mind (Besides completing the project).

  - Become more comfortable with git and github
  - Understand how specific functions work before I use them
  - Ask for help if necessary

Initially, I spent a lot of time working on goal #2. For a few days I would read the textbook and attempt the exercises that
were given to me. Despite how many of them did not directly benefit me for the project, they did get me thinking about how
to effectively apply concepts to solutions. However, once I tried to start working on the project, I ran into a big
problem:
  - I was not sure where to start and I couldn't get myself out of it
 
So, I started asking my more experienced friends what they would do. After discussing what they do when they are stuck in a
rut. We concluded that I should use the code from lecture as my jumping-off point, because "Professor Carter was tossing me a bone there". That got me started, however I ran into compiler errors that spawned becuase I was not used to working with someone else's code from github. I asked Professor Carter for help and that gave me the momentum I needed to develop the project and my project-based programming skills. 

I went from feeling lost because I could not deal with the roadblocks that come with coding to understanding how to engage with other programmers in a coherent discourse where they can help me and I can effectively explain the issue that I am having. The excitement of discovery that I had with project #2 was magnified once I managed to overcome the issues I was having in project #3. I feel more competent as a programmer, not just because I understand how a new function works but also since I feel like if I run into problems in the future I will be able to help myself or know how to ask for the help that I need.

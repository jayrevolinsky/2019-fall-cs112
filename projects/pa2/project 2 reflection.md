#Project 2 Reflection - Jay Revolinsky

I was unaware that the my program was not outputting the results of my getline function because the file path "tinypix.ppm"
did not work. Once I changed the destination to the same as the relative file path of my repository folder the program ran
just as I intended it to. This posed a particular challenge for me because I believed that I had developed each part of the program
sequentially. However, learning the ins and outs of a function like .open was not a priority of mine. It should have been.
Instead I proceeded with the coding the program on the blind hope that the function would work how I imagined it. Now, I understand
that if I am unsure about a the properties of a certain function. I will save time if I look up the references and tinker with the
current configuration than if I just rely on faith and luck especially with more complex programs.

Despite this difficulty, the amount of fun I had working on this assignment made me realize how much I love to program. I was able
to find multiple references that were helpful and allowed me to read from the tinypix file in several different ways. I managed to 
tinker with those different ways to come up with solutions that came to the same conclusion from separate routes. Finally, once I
found on a grasp on how the separate routes came to their solution, I decided on the solution that worked best for my intentions
and the assignment. This whole process lead to an intellectual journey for me, the low points were marked by me probing around for
an answer to my particular questions online and the high points were marked by the discovery of how a new function works,
especially in tandem with other functions. In my entire college career this is the most I have felt like a scientist. The work I 
managed to do did not feel like work but something more fulfilling.

I feel like this assignment came at an awkward time. Since the assignment was due while you were out of town, I was not able to ask
the final questions that I had in person which is my preferred method. However, I realize now that a well-written e-mail or asking
a tutor or a forum post would have worked as well.
